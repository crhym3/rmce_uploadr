= How to run

It is pretty much setup already. <tt>db/development.sqlite3</tt> contains valid <tt>posts</tt> (empty) table so all you need to do is run

  bundle install
 
(you'll need bundler gem for that) and

  scripts/server

(you'll need shotgun gem)

Point your browser to http://localhost:3000
